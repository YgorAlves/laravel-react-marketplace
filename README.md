## To run this project locally, you need to run 3 commands


### Backend
- `make up`

- wait for all containers to be up, aprox 10s

- `make init`

### Frontend
- `cd frontend-react`
- `npm install'
- `npm run dev`

For the backend you don't need php locally, its all dockerized.

For the frontend, all node versions above v14.17.6 should work.
